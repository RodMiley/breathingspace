<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="applying">Applying for a breathing space moratorium</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Debtors can only enter the Debt Respite Scheme using a debt adviser. 
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
Anyone who cannot or is unlikely to be able to repay their debts can apply to a debt adviser for a Breathing Space. 
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
Although all applications for the scheme must be considered, the debt adviser might decide a Breathing Space is not appropriate for a debtor. 
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
For example, if a person could pay their debts with some budgeting help, or they already have assets that could be sold to clear the debt, a Breathing Space would not be the right solution. A Breathing Space might also not be appropriate for a someone who can enter a more suitable debt solution straight away, without needing the scheme’s protections.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="stantard">Debtor eligibility for a breathing space moratorium</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
Before a debt adviser can put someone into Breathing Space, they must confirm the debtor meets all the conditions for a moratorium. These are that the debtor must:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>A debtor must owe a qualifying debt to a creditor</li>
<li>A debtor must live or usually resides in England or Wales</li>
<li>A debtor must not have a debt relief order (DRO), an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA), an interim order, or be an undischarged bankrupt at the time they apply</li>
<li>A debtor must not already be in Breathing Space or have been one in the last 12 months at the time they apply</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">
The debtor must also meet both of the conditions. These are that: 
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>A debtor cannot, or is unlikely to be able to, repay all or some of their debt </li>
<li>The debt adviser thinks that a moratorium is appropriate for the debtor</li>
</ul>




<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="mh">Debtor eligibility for a mental health crisis moratorium</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The debtor must still meet the same criteria and conditions for a breathing space moratorium, but they must also be receiving mental health crisis treatment at the time they apply.</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>There is no limit to how many times a debtor can enter a mental health crisis moratorium.</li>
</ul>
